Classification with Reject in Bayesian Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation: Automating Pixelwise Reject Thresholds Using Bayes Error

Data from here (http://amsacta.unibo.it/id/eprint/6706/) should be placed in the 'data/' directory in its raw unzipped format. Run the Python scripts 'resize.py' and 'resize1.py' in order to process that data into the datasets used in this experiment.
